Markdown Equivalency in LaTeX
=============================

This is the "source code" for my basic LaTeX tutorial. It's aimed at users who
are familiar with Markdown, but are new to (and possibly bewildered by) the
dazzling array of possibilities that LaTeX has to offer.

Both Markdown and LaTeX versions are available, allowing the tutorial itself to
serve as an example of how its own principles can be applied to a complete
document. The two versions are kept in sync manually, so please report any
discrepancies if you find them.
